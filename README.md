Hackathon GNUnas Edition 


Song Theme - 4 Non Blondes What's up?


// The Idea
This project is a part of the hackathon session at <Academia de Código_> where we were challenged to create an application which should match the theme song provided to us. The theme of our project was on the song called “What’s up?” by 4 Non Blondes.
We decided that the song theme would point to gender equality and woman rights. With that on our head, we brainstormed into a game idea that would be intended for two players (even though it could be single player) where the woman would be in charge of what actions the man, facing different kinds of obstacles would be able to do in order to surpass them. The main goal of the game was to achieve perfect cooperation between a man and a woman. 
With that said, we decided to try out LibGDX for the game implementation which was a graphical library none of us had even heard before, but it’s extensive documentation, made us pretty confident we would be able to get what we needed out of it with some work.

// The Development
For the development we started by reading some LibGDX documentation, as we had been taught the hole past 3 months, and some tutorials, in order to understand as much as possible how it worked. 
After that, as we became more confident of how to work with this library, we started developing the game feature by feature, sprint by sprint. 
We merged working features using Git at the end of every sprint, updated everyone on the game progress and planned for the next two hours.
At the end of the challenge, we managed to deliver an amazing and challenging game, with all of the features we had planned, with a bit of a messy code due to the rush pressure we had. 
Finally, in the last two hours, we worked on the presentation that would follow right after the 24h period was over.
